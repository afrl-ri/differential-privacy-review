This repository contains the base code for our review of high dimensional differentially private linear models. ```lin_autoproc.py``` and ```log_autoproc.py``` contain the code to run experiments for all algorithms other than GCD. ```lin_autoproc_gcd.py``` and ```log_autoproc_gcd.py``` contain the code to run experiments for GCD. All optimizers other than GCD were coded from scratch and can be found in ```optimizers/```.
